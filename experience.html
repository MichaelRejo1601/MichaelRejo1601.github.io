      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h3>Through my engineering journey through highschool, I have been given several wonderful oppertunities to learn about and interact with the world of engineering! Here I would like to share these experiences, and what I took away from them!</h3>

      <h1>Guest Speakers</h1>
      <h2>
          A guest speaker who I really enjoyed was Maher Salloum. He taught me about how easy it is to move around in the world of engineering. Through talking about two of his projects, he showed us how he transfered easily from one field to anoter by adapting his skills! As someone who is intrested in many fields of engineering, this talk really intrested me. It made me consider the massive amount of career possibilities in the field of engineering!
          Another guest speaker who inspired me is Jason Yosinski. Jason came in to discuss with us the concept of Machine Learning on a theoretical level. As someone who is already intrested in the field of machine learning and neural networks, I enjoyed learning even more about the field. Jason was able to help me with some of my conceptions of the way machine learning works through his demonstration of his Deep Learning Visualizer. This experience was extremely insightful and fun!

      <h1>Volunteering</h1>
      <h2>
I have been able to volunteer at many places during my highschool career from the library to helping organize events. However, out of all my experiences, one stood out to me the most, Coder Dojo. My volunteer experience at Coder Dojo has been great. Not only did I get to sit down and help kids who needed tutoring for coding, but I also got to make connections with many amazing individuals there! So far, I have volunteered weekly for 2 years at my Coder Dojo. Over time I have also been involved with the leadership and running of the club. I've also promoted growth for the club by trying to develop applications to enhance the experience for those attending.

      <h1>Field Trips</h1>
      <h2>One of my most important trips that I took this year was to SunPower, a solar company. However, what I intrested me was not the solar panels themselves, but the engineers at the company. In particular, I met a mechanical engeineer named Sam. I asked Sam about his journey to becoming and engineer, and what he needed to get to where he was today. He told me that although it is important have good grades and know the subject, it is not the most important thing. One of the most valuable skills he had was his speaking and team skills! This trip let me talk to 3 engineers and hear all their stories too, which gave me insight that I really wanted into what it was like to get into engineering. These engineers also explained to me their projects and average work days!</h2>

    <div class="mentor">
      <h1>Mentorship Program</h1>
      <h2>
The mentorship program here at the Dublin High Engineering and Design Academy has been very informative and helpful. Through my mentor Matthew Kweder and the many other mentors present, I've learned how to get the most from college, weigh the different opportunities presented in the workforce, utilize soft skills to communicate better, and overall how to navigate the complex future I will encounter as I start a career.
