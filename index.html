            <p> This project was to create a visual seating chart in Java for our teacher to learn about us. Each student would create a interactive avatar of themselves
              in Greenfoot, a Java game engine. Later, they would be merged together into one single Java "game".
              <br />
              <br  />
              With such a large project, including around 30 students, consistency and management is essential. We chose Github to manage the project,
              implementing a feature-branch method. In this method, all features (the indiviual avatars), are developed on copies of the master branch. After the features are
              complete, they are merged back into master. However the feature branch still brings complications. If there are conflicts between the files, they will have to be
              manually resolved or may not merge at all.
              <br />
              <br  />
              I took the responsibility of "Git Master". My role consisted of assuring that all members of the project follow the agreed workflow and programming
              guidelines, setting deadlines, helping members who
              were in need of technical assistance, and overall coordinating the flow of the project. Finally as Git Master, I had to
              merge and test all created features to assure compatibility. This was a difficult but invaluable experience. It was a challenge
              to lead such a large project because I needed to assure that many procedures were. One of the main issues was that many students
              would program in ways that were incompatible with other student's code.
              For example, many students would change the Java interfaces (that were used by all the students), which caused other's to not work upon merging. I had to communicate
              this issue to the class so all the students would be on the same page. Another similar occurance of this was members who did not fully follow the Git workflow. I had to
              also communicate these to the class in addition to releasing a easy to understand guide to undoing common mistakes!
              <br />
              <br  />
              For this project, I learned a large sum of Github, version control, and Java in order to prevent and solve issues during the project creation process. I also
              learned many invaluable leadership skills, such as communicating ideas to a group, getting consensus, helping others in need, prioritizing, and seeing the bigger picture.
              I even learned many virtues including: patience, open-mindness, and stress management. Although it was one of my hardest projects, I've learned an extrodinary amount of technical,
              personal, and soft skills through it!

              Our mission was simple for this project. Research a new technology and create a demo using it. I worked with a partner for this project and we ended up choosing Django, a python based web application framework.
              <br />
              <br  />
              During this project, we learned how to manage a project with short time constraints and uncertainty. Since we were given only 1 week to build a demo and we both had to learn about Django, it was important that we decided the scope of our project. After doing research and distributing tasks, we proceeded to work on the project. Production went smoothly because we made sure to allow ourselves time to deal with hiccups in the development process.
              <br />
              <br  />
              Overall, this was one of the most intresting projects I have completed. It helped me develop the ability to properly scope projects and consider the soft aspects of development. It also helped solidy my teamworking skills. Both my partner and I were able to efficiently divide the programming tasks into feasable amounts in order to finish the project successfully!

            <p> This classroom project asked for my two partners and I to create a design for a chatbot that could participate in conversation. The main constraints were that we had to use Java to
              program it and had a time constraint of 2 days. With these in mind, my group and I came up with Mozbot. Mozbot is a chatbot based on the famous composer
              Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The chatbot works by taking a raw input String from the user. The chatbot tokenizes the string, removing all unnecessary characters
              and parts. Then it parses the string for keywords that would signify what the user is trying to ask. To meet the project requirements,
              we added 30 hard coded responses to certain keywords.
              <br />
              <br  />
              However, it is not possible to stimulate good conversation with only pre-programmed responses.
              Thus our group decided to innovate a system for the chatbot to learn. Whenever a user would ask a foriegn question, the chatbot would ask the user how they would
              respond to their question. It will then store the question-answer set in a storage file.
              We made use of Java's reader and writter classes in order to create the storage file. Later, if a user asked the same question, the chatbot would query it's storage
              for the responses. The greatest challenge of this project was to use our limited tools to create something complex such as human conversation. In end, although the
              solution was not perfect, our group was able to innovate a solution that met the requirements with the given constraints!
