            <p> This project was to create a visual seating chart in Java for our teacher to learn about us. Each student would create a interactive avatar of themselves
              in Greenfoot, a Java game engine. Later, they would be merged together into one single Java "game".
              <br />
              <br  />
              With such a large project, including around 30 students, consistency and management is essential. We chose Github to manage the project,
              implementing a feature-branch method. In this method, all features (the indiviual avatars), are developed on copies of the master branch. After the features are
              complete, they are merged back into master. However the feature branch still brings complications. If there are conflicts between the files, they will have to be
              manually resolved or may not merge at all.
              <br />
              <br  />
              I took the responsibility of "Git Master". My role consisted of assuring that all members of the project follow the agreed workflow and programming
              guidelines, setting deadlines, helping members who
              were in need of technical assistance, and overall coordinating the flow of the project. Finally as Git Master, I had to
              merge and test all created features to assure compatibility. This was a difficult but invaluable experience. It was a challenge
              to lead such a large project because I needed to assure that many procedures were. One of the main issues was that many students
              would program in ways that were incompatible with other student's code.
              For example, many students would change the Java interfaces (that were used by all the students), which caused other's to not work upon merging. I had to communicate
              this issue to the class so all the students would be on the same page. Another similar occurance of this was members who did not fully follow the Git workflow. I had to
              also communicate these to the class in addition to releasing a easy to understand guide to undoing common mistakes!
              <br />
              <br  />
              For this project, I learned a large sum of Github, version control, and Java in order to prevent and solve issues during the project creation process. I also
              learned many invaluable leadership skills, such as communicating ideas to a group, getting consensus, helping others in need, prioritizing, and seeing the bigger picture.
              I even learned many virtues including: patience, open-mindness, and stress management. Although it was one of my hardest projects, I've learned an extrodinary amount of technical,
              personal, and soft skills through it!
