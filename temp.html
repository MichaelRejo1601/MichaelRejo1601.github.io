        The objective of this project was to create a efficient and working car prototype that used renewable energy sources. The sources we used in this project were solar and hydrogen. In the end, we created a fully functioning mini-car that could run on up to two solar or hydrogen cells. One sign of growth during this project was the lack of complications. We efficiently designed and created our model vehicle. When there were problems, we were able to solve them in a calm manner. Individually, I worked on the design of the prototype, helped with assembly of the body, and worked on the circutry. The project overall taught me about different energy sources and their uses. Most importantly, however, it taught me good time management and team ettiquete!
